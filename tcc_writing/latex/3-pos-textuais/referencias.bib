ABSTRACT = {The operation of the world’s first multimode continuous casting and rolling F3 (3rd finishing mill stand) finishing mill was hampered by frequent vibrations. Mill vibrations were found to be caused by the transmission and coupling of vibration energy flow. In this study, an overall finite element model of the F3 stand is established based on the structural sound intensity method and harmonic response analysis method, and then, the intrinsic energy flow modes and energy flow harmonic response of the F3 stand are obtained. Further, the effects of the steady-state rolling force variation, preload torque variation, rolling force fluctuation, torque fluctuation, and its phase angle difference on the vibration energy flow of the mill are analyzed. Finally, the effects of the mill damping ratio, strip width, and strip modulus on the vibration energy flow under double dynamic load are discussed to reveal the inherent characteristics of the mill vibration energy flow. The results show that the vibration energy flow of the mill increases with the increase of strip modulus, rolling force, and moment fluctuation; the phase angle difference of rolling moment shows a “V” trend change on the vibration energy flow; the change of strip width has a greater effect on the vibration energy flow of the vertical system; and for the damping ratio of 0.01–0.1, the reduction of the vibration energy flow at all excitation frequencies is obvious.},

ABSTRACT = {Flood forecasting is an essential requirement in integrated water resource management. This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99%, 95%, and 87% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and deep learning (DL) are all topics that fall under the heading of artificial intelligence (AI) and have gained popularity in recent years. ML involves the application of algorithms to automate decision-making processes using models that have not been manually programmed but have been trained on data. ANNs that are a part of ML aim to simulate the structure and function of the human brain. DL, on the other hand, uses multiple layers of interconnected neurons. This enables the processing and analysis of large and complex databases. In medicine, these techniques are being introduced to improve the speed and efficiency of disease diagnosis and treatment. Each of the AI techniques presented in the paper is supported with an example of a possible medical application. Given the rapid development of technology, the use of AI in medicine shows promising results in the context of patient care. It is particularly important to keep a close eye on this issue and conduct further research in order to fully explore the potential of ML, ANNs, and DL, and bring further applications into clinical use in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes an optimized random forest regression model to achieve online battery prognostics and health management. To estimate the battery state of health (SOH), two aging features (AFs) are extracted based on the incremental capacity curve (ICC) to quantify capacity degradation, further analyzed through Pearson’s correlation coefficient. To further predict the remaining useful life (RUL), the online AFs are extrapolated to predict the degradation trends through the closed-loop least square method. To capture the underlying relationship between AFs and capacity, a random forest regression model is developed; meanwhile, the hyperparameters are determined using Bayesian optimization (BO) to enhance the learning and generalization ability. The method of co-simulation using MATLAB and LabVIEW is introduced to develop a battery management system (BMS) for online verification of the proposed method. Based on the open-access battery aging datasets, the results for the mean error of estimated SOH is 1.8152% and the predicted RUL is 32 cycles, which is better than some common methods.},

abstract = {Machine learning applied to regression models offers powerful mathematical tools for predicting responses based on one or more predictor variables. This paper extends the concept of multiple linear regression by implementing a learning system and incorporating both fuzzy predictors and fuzzy responses. To estimate the unknown parameters of this soft regression model, the approach involves minimizing the absolute distance between two lines under three constraints related to the absolute error distance between observed data and their respective predicted lines. A thorough comparative analysis is conducted, showcasing the practical applicability and superiority of the proposed soft multiple linear regression model. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through a comprehensive examination involving simulation studies and real-life application examples.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilized in a wide range of sophisticated applications, but the outcomes of many AI models are challenging to comprehend and trust due to their black-box nature. Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.}
